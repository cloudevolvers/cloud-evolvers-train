    "story": "As someone who has guided hundreds of professionals into Azure, I've seen firsthand how the right foundation makes all the difference. I remember working with a team of traditional infrastructure engineers who were skeptical about cloud. After this training, they successfully migrated their first workloads to Azure and became cloud advocates. This course distills everything I wish I knew when I started with Azure."
