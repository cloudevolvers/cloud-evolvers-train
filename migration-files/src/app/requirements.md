# Homepage Layout Requirements

## Layout Structure (Top to Bottom)
1. **Header with Banner** - Banner should appear above header when scrolled up without flickering
2. **Hero Section** - Enclosed in a block similar to other sections
3. **Live Dashboard Block** - Small block directly under hero (no whitespace)
4. **Blog Section** - Positioned directly under live dashboard, visible on 1080p screens
5. **Services Section** - On one side, no scrollbar, properly aligned
6. **Showcase Section** - Improved design and usability
7. **Training Section** - Positioned on the right side
